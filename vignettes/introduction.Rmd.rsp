[RBi.helpers](https://github.com/sbfnk/RBi.helpers) is collection of helper functions to use with [RBi](https://github.com/libbi/RBi), an R interface to [LibBi](https://github.com/libbi/LibBi), a library for Bayesian Inference.

### Latest Version: _0.2.0_  &nbsp; <small>(5 May 2016)</small>

This vignette builds on the [RBi vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rbi/vignettes/introduction.html), applying the higher-level functions contained in **RBi.helpers** to the same model introduced there.
For the lower-level functions to run **LibBi** and read the results, please refer to the documentation and vignette that comes with **RBi**.

# Installation

The **RBi.helpers** package requires `R` (>= 3.2.0) as well as the packages:

- `rbi`
- `data.table`
- `reshape2`
- `lubridate`
- `coda`
- `ggplot2`
- `scales`
- `GGally`

Most functions also require a working installation of **LibBi**.
Please see the [RBi vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rbi/vignettes/introduction.html) for how to get one via homebrew or linuxbrew.

The package name of **RBi.helpers** is `rbi.helpers` (all lowercase).
The current stable version can be installed using the `devtools` package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
library('devtools')
install_github("sbfnk/rbi.helpers")
```

# Loading the package

Use

```{R}
library('rbi.helpers')
```
to load the package.

# Loading the model and generating a synthetic dataset

These steps are reproduced from the [RBi vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rbi/vignettes/introduction.html), where there is more information on the individual steps

```{R}
model_file <- system.file(package="rbi", "SIR.bi") # get full file name from package
SIRmodel <- bi_model(model_file) # load model
SIRdata <- bi_generate_dataset(SIRmodel, end_time=16*7, noutputs=16, seed=12345678)
```

# Adapt the number of particles

In the [RBi vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rbi/vignettes/introduction.html), a [stochastic SIR model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/libbi/RBi/master/inst/SIR.bi) was fitted to simulated data from the same model using particle Markov-chain Monte Carlo with 16 particles.
Given a model and data, how do we know how many particles we need?
This question does not have a simple answer, as the "optimal" number of particles may depend on the state of the Markov chain.
A possible rule-of-thumb is to choose the number of particles such that the variance of the log-likelihood near the mode is approximately one.
This suggests a [strategy](https://darrenjw.wordpress.com/2014/06/08/tuning-particle-mcmc-algorithms/) by which first and approximate location of the mode or mean of the posterior distribution is obtained in a trial run, before the numer of particles is adjusted by monitoring the variance of the log-likelihood while keeping the parameters fixed.
**RBi.helpers** implements the second part of this strategy (adjusting the number of particles at a given location in parameter space) with the `adapt_particles` method.
For the first part (finding the mode), a crude method is to take a fixed number of samples from the prior distribution and choose the one that maximises the posterior distribution.
In **RBi**, this can be achieved with

```{R}
SIRmodel_prior <- SIRmodel$propose_prior()
bi_prior <- libbi(SIRmodel_prior, nsamples=1000, end_time=16*7, noutputs=16, nparticles=16, obs=SIRdata, seed=1234)
bi_prior$run()
```

The first line changes the `bi_model` object called SIRmodel to have the prior distribution as proposal distribution.
In other words, when sampling from the posterior the proposals will be drawn independently from the prior distribution.
The second line performs the sampling.
Note that we set a seed to make the results reproducible.
It is worth trying the commands with a different seed and seeing the difference to the results obtained below.
The location in parameters of the sampler at the end of the 1000 samples will give an approximation of the mode of the posterior distribution.
This can then be used to adjust the number of particles using

```{R}
adapted <- adapt_particles(bi_prior)
```

This will take the last sample of the output file contained in the `libbi` object `bi_prior`, and use it to adjust the number of particles by starting with 1 particle (or a given `min`) and doubling it until the variance of the loglikelihood crosses 1.
The number of particles is then saved in the `adapted` object:

```{R}
adapted$options$nparticles
```

# Adapt the proposal distribution

Having adjusted the number of particles, the second important information to give the posterior sampler is the proposal distribution.
This can, again, be obtained using a sequence of trial runs, whereby the proposal distribution is sequentially adjusted from previous samples to be proportional to the empirical covariance of the posterior samples.
The way this is implemented in the `adapt_proposal` function in **RBi.helpers** is that first the /size/ of the proposal distribution is adjusted by adjusting independent normal proposals for each parameter until the acceptance rate lies between a given minimum and maximum (by default, 0.1 and 0.5), before the /shape/ of the distribution is adjusted by changing the proposals to come from a multivariate normal taking into account the full covariance of samples, again until the acceptance rate lies between the given minimum and maximum.
For example, to adjust the proposal distribution for an acceptance rate between 0.05 and 0.4, we can run:

```{R}
adapted_proposal <- adapt_proposal(adapted, min=0.05, max=0.4)
```

The adjusted proposals are stored in the `bi_model` contained in the `libbi` object `adapted_proposal`

```{R}
adapted_proposal$model$get_block("proposal_parameters")
```

Note that the multivariate normal is realised as a series of conditionally dependent draws from normal distributions.
The model can be saved via

```{R}
adapted_proposal$model$write("SIR.bi")
````

The steps above are exactly the steps used to create the proposal blocks in the file `SIR.bi` contained in the **RBi** package and used in its vignette.

# Plot libbi objects

Let us run take 5,000 samples from the posterior distribution of the model using the adapted proposal and number of particles:

```{R}
posterior <- adapted_proposal$clone(run=TRUE, nsamples=5000, nparticles=16, sample_obs=TRUE)
```

Note that we used the `sample_obs` option to also generate posterior predictive samples from of the observations.

Instead of using the [coda](https://cran.r-project.org/package=coda) routines for plotting as described in the [RBi vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rbi/vignettes/introduction.html#analysing-an-mcmc-run), one can use the `plot_libbi` function.
If passed a `libbi` object, it can be called using `plot`.

```{R}
p <- plot(posterior)
```

There are various options available for controlling the plots.
See `?plot_libbi` for a description of all the different available arguments.

The returned object `p` contains a number of different plots:

```{R}
names(p)
```

## State trajectories

```{R}
p$states
```

Note that this plots the data on top of the observation trajectory, because we have sampled with `sample_obs=TRUE`.

## Trace plot

```{R}
p$traces
```

## Posterior densities

```{R}
p$densities
```

This plots histograms.
Smooth density interpolations can be plotted by passing `densities="density"` to `plot_libbi`.

## Pairwise correlation plot

```{R}
p$correlations
```

## Pairs plot

```{R}
p$pairs
```

## Noise plot

```{R}
p$noise
```

## Summary data

All the data used for the different plots are stored in the `data` object:

```{R}
p$data
```

# Compute DIC

To compute the [Deviance Information Criterion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deviance_information_criterion) (DIC), use `compute_DIC`:

```{R}
compute_DIC(p)
```

# Recreate `libbi` objects

To recreate a `libbi` object from a previous R session, use `recreate_libbi`.
For example, one could use the following code to get the acceptance rate and plots for a *LibBi* run with a given output and model file:

```{R}
PZ_run_file <- system.file(package="rbi.helpers", "example_run.nc")
PZ_model_file <- system.file(package="rbi", "PZ.bi")
PZ_posterior <- recreate_libbi(PZ_model_file, PZ_run_file)
acceptance_rate(PZ_posterior) 
```
